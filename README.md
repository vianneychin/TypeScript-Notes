### 🗒 @type/declaration Notes

### 📓 TypeScript Notes

- ? — Optional argument.
- | — Adds an additional clause if the class has the same property for a function.
- interface — Indicates that it's going to be an object.
- **Private** — \*\*\*\*Disallows any other engineers from using certain methods in an API. This reduces the complexity of our application and makes it certain to what we can or cannot do in our application.
